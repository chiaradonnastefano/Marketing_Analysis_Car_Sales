* Sales performance across car brands and models
* Customer behavior
* KPIs: Click-per-customer (CPC), Customer-Acquisition-Cost (CAC), Return-on-Investment (ROI)
* Impact of marketing spend across channels

## ‚úÖ Results

To optimize the return on the 20% budget increase, the new spend should prioritize Social Media and Online Video channels, which offer the highest ROI, while shifting away from Third Party Listings. Investment should also focus on partnerships with Debit Dharma and Giving Vine, which have the lowest customer acquisition costs (CAC). For specific campaigns, the budget should be allocated to Sedan, Convertible, 25+, and Truck, which have the highest number of sales.

Additionally, due to its consistently negative ROI throughout the evaluation period, we recommend eliminating or significantly reducing spend on the Third Party Listings category. Although there was some sales growth from November to December, with ManualBarter and RealTruck seeing an increase in sales by 14 and 18, respectively, the negative ROI indicates that the cost of acquisition exceeds the value of the sales. Furthermore, Third Party Listings incur the second-highest cost-per-click, further increasing expenses. Consequently, this budget should be reallocated to higher-performing channels with positive ROI.
